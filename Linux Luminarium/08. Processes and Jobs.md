# Module 8. Processes and Jobs.
## 1. Listing Processes. 
**Task:** learning to list processes using `ps` (process snapshot or status), and the various arguments used to make it useful.
</br></br>
**Arguments:** ***STANDARD SYNTAX-***
               `-e`: to list every process. </br>
               `-f`: for full format </br>
               `-ef`: For the functionality of both `-e` and `-f`.
</br></br>
               ***BSD SYNTAX:***
               `a`: to list processes for all users. </br>
               `u`: for for a user-readable output. </br>
               `x`: to list processes that aren't running in a terminal. </br>
               `aux`: For the functionality of `a`, `u` and `x`.
               </br></br>

**Process:** using either `ps aux` or `ps -ef` to found the hidden run process. and running it.
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~listing-processes:~$ ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 05:47 ?        00:00:00 /sbin/docker-init -- /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin/dojo-init /ru
root           7       1  0 05:47 ?        00:00:00 /run/dojo/bin/sleep 6h
root          68       1  0 05:47 ?        00:00:00 /challenge/23355-run-5873
root          72      68  0 05:47 ?        00:00:00 sleep 6h
hacker        73       0  0 05:47 pts/0    00:00:00 /run/dojo/bin/ssh-entrypoint
hacker        91      73  0 06:11 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -ef
hacker@processes~listing-processes:~$ /challenge/23355-run-5873
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QTd7H7vdVRy3gEhP1sNq12OVV8c.dhzM4QDLxYTN0czW}
```
***or***
```bash
hacker@processes~listing-processes:~$ ps aux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root           1  0.0  0.0   1056   640 ?        Ss   05:47   0:00 /sbin/docker-init -- /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bi
root           7  0.0  0.0   5052  2240 ?        S    05:47   0:00 /run/dojo/bin/sleep 6h
root          68  0.0  0.0   4132  2560 ?        S    05:47   0:00 /challenge/23355-run-5873
root          72  0.0  0.0   2744  1280 ?        S    05:47   0:00 sleep 6h
hacker        73  0.0  0.0   5376  4160 pts/0    Ss   05:47   0:00 /run/dojo/bin/ssh-entrypoint
hacker        92  0.0  0.0   7868  3520 pts/0    R+   06:11   0:00 ps aux
hacker@processes~listing-processes:~$ /challenge/23355-run-5873
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QTd7H7vdVRy3gEhP1sNq12OVV8c.dhzM4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{QTd7H7vdVRy3gEhP1sNq12OVV8c.dhzM4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 2. Killing Processes
**Task:** To learn the use of `kill` command.
</br></br>
**Process:**  `kill` command is used with the _Process identifier_ or the _PID_ found in the `ps`, as its argument. 
</br> we do exactly that, by first finding the `/challenge/dont_run` process and killing it. then we can run the `/challenge/run` command.
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ ps -ef | grep dont
hacker        73      71  0 06:31 ?        00:00:00 /challenge/dont_run
hacker        93      75  0 06:32 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto dont
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ kill 73
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ /challenge/run
Great job! Here is your payment:
pwn.college{kg9JGR4TlKaD3fx6uzxQmlwuAg8.dJDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{kg9JGR4TlKaD3fx6uzxQmlwuAg8.dJDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 3. Interrupting Processes
**Task:** Interrupting Processes by using in-built Hot-key `Ctrl+C`
</br></br>
**Process:** `/challenge/run` would only give us the flag if we interrupt it. so by pressing the hotkey `Ctrl+C` after running `/challenge/run`, we get the flag.
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{o5Ln05bWoWZUw0eBstACsObWRev.dNDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{o5Ln05bWoWZUw0eBstACsObWRev.dNDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 4. Suspending Processes
**Task:** Suspending processes using hot-key `Ctrl+Z`
</br></br>
**Process:** The Task requires us to run a copy of the `/challenge/run` command while it is suspended. 
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root          82      65  0 06:40 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run
root          84      82  0 06:40 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me and launch me again! You can
background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root          82      65  0 06:40 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run
root          89      65  0 06:40 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/run
root          91      89  0 06:40 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f

Yay, I found another version of me! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{kb0mi-T5833CVYtFXnt42wiSd2E.dVDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{kb0mi-T5833CVYtFXnt42wiSd2E.dVDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 5. Resuming Processes
**Task:** Using `fg` (foreground) command to resume a suspended process.
</br></br>
**Process:** running `/challenge/run`, Suspending it, and then `fg`'ing it back to the foreground.
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ /challenge/run
Let's practice resuming processes! Suspend me with Ctrl-Z, then resume me with
the 'fg' command! Or just press Enter to quit me!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
I'm back! Here's your flag:
pwn.college{kt5DoFzFf5fxivz7GIBuSAqQPjX.dZDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{kt5DoFzFf5fxivz7GIBuSAqQPjX.dZDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 6. Backgrounding Processes.
**Task:** Using `bg` (background) command to send a process to the background.
</br></br>

**Process:** Running the run process, suspending it, `bg`'ing it to the background and then running the run command again.
</br>

```bash
Connected!
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          82 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          84 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times
to scroll this text out.
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          82 S    bash /challenge/run
root          92 S    sleep 6h
root          93 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          95 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{4WtjxqLKnJgO6Fu6fJqviax4owT.ddDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{4WtjxqLKnJgO6Fu6fJqviax4owT.ddDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br></br>
**Argument(s):** we learn about a new argument: `-o`
</br>
if we enter `ps -o  user,pid,stat,cmd` we get a tabular format of the processes, and the status of the process is displayed under `stat`.
</br>
_Note: when the status of a process is `T`, it means that it is suspended._
</br>
_when it's `R`, it means its running, and `+` means its in the foreground._

## 7. Foregrounding Processes
**Task:** Using `fg` to reverse the actions of `bg` without making any changes to the status of the process.
</br></br>
**Process:** running `/challenge/run`, suspending it, `bg`'ing it into the background and `fg`'ing it back to the foreground. 
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and *then* foreground it without re-suspending it! You can
background me with Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if
you're not ready to do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times
to scroll this text out. After that, resume me into the foreground with 'fg';
I'll wait.
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
YES! Great job! I'm now running in the foreground. Hit Enter for your flag!

pwn.college{QBc-P2mg3bjW_jGiw_73ZUVbJp8.dhDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{QBc-P2mg3bjW_jGiw_73ZUVbJp8.dhDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 8. Starting Backgrounded Processes
**Task:** Sending a process to the background without suspending it, using `&` when invoking the process.
</br></br>
**Process:** running `/challenge/run &`
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 83



hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wE4mU0k3C7x9Y59wMlJ4BX2s6GW.dlDN4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{wE4mU0k3C7x9Y59wMlJ4BX2s6GW.dlDN4QDLxYTN0czW}`

## 9. Process Exit Codes
**Task:** Accessing exit codes of most recently run commands by using `?`
</br></br>
**Process:** Running the command `/challenge/get-code` and checking for its error message using `echo $?`. Using that error message as the argument for `/challenge/submit-code` to get the flag.
</br>

```bash
hacker@processes~process-exit-codes:~$ /challenge/get-code
Exiting with an error code!
hacker@processes~process-exit-codes:~$ echo $?
193
hacker@processes~process-exit-codes:~$ /challenge/submit-code 193
CORRECT! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kGiMntMAgXwaAhSGUDoTDryE-Zv.dljN4UDLxYTN0czW}
```

**flag:** `pwn.college{kGiMntMAgXwaAhSGUDoTDryE-Zv.dljN4UDLxYTN0czW}`
