# Module 5: File Globbing
## 1. Matching with *

**Task:** Understanding _file globbing_ and use of `*` as wildcard

**Process:** Did what is asked in the task. Using the wild card `*` to be used in place of `/challenge`
</br>
its given that the argument needs to be 4 characters in length, so we use `/ch*` where `*` is the wildcard.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
This challenge resets your working directory to /home/hacker unless you change
directory properly...
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Q4qgiOfLg4qqBt83H_YIOQb3M-9.dFjM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q4qgiOfLg4qqBt83H_YIOQb3M-9.dFjM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 2. Matching with ?

**Task:** Understanding _file globbing_ and use of `?` as wildcard

**Process:** Did what is asked in the task. Using the wild card `?` to be used in place of `/challenge` to  represent the missing chracters `c and l`
</br>
so we use `/?ha??enge` as the argument of `cd`.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
This challenge resets your working directory to /home/hacker unless you change
directory properly...
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{opjmVGVkf7DnG3b-dYoNN5RlI4d.dJjM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{opjmVGVkf7DnG3b-dYoNN5RlI4d.dJjM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 3. Matching with [ ]

**Task:** Understanding _file globbing_ and use of `[ ]` as wildcard

**Process:** Again, did what is asked. Using the wild card `[ ]` to be used in place of `/challenge` to only allow the characters mentioned inside the brackets
</br>


**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{EprVrf37mBmLPPjD7fFFFl8ZVdu.dNjM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$
```
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EprVrf37mBmLPPjD7fFFFl8ZVdu.dNjM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 4. Matching paths with [ ]

**Task:** Understanding _file globbing_ and use of `[ ]` as wildcard to get multiple files globbed

**Process:** Using the wild card `[ ]` to be used in place of `/challenge` to glob multiple files with the the chracters `[absh]`
</br>
again, simple direction. did what was asked. the difference from the last task is that we globbed the file(s) directly from `/home/hacker` or `~` rather than using `cd /challenge/files`.
</br>

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:/challenge/files$ cd ~
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Iq-zfdwiykVKLs2-5nNG_RtgNEe.dRjM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{Iq-zfdwiykVKLs2-5nNG_RtgNEe.dRjM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 5. Mixing globs

**Task:** Understanding _file globbing_ and using multiple wildcards

**Process:** Using multiple wildcards to glob a file
</br>
`[]` wildcard is used to account for the first characters of the files, and the `*` wildcard is used to account for the characters that come after. When we run `/challenge/run [cep]*`, it checks for every file whose name starts with either c,e or p `[cep]` , and has characters following it `(*)`.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ ls
amazing      educational  incredible  magical     queenly    uplifting   youthful
beautiful    fantastic    jovial      nice        radiant    victorious  zesty
challenging  great        kind        optimistic  splendid   wonderful
delightful   happy        laughing    pwning      thrilling  xenial
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Q_JwWctpjKvQJa34DoPvWpf3wcr.dVjM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$

```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q_JwWctpjKvQJa34DoPvWpf3wcr.dVjM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 6. Exclusionary globbing

**Task:** Understanding _file globbing_ and use of `!` or `^` as wildcard

**Process:** Using the wild card `!` to be used in place of `/challenge` to exclude files that include the characters `[pwn]`
</br>
Something to be noted is that `!` should be used carefully, as in bash, it has a different meaning when its not a first character, than when it is. this is not a problem with `^`, but the problem with that is that it only works in the newer versions.

**Code:**</br>
```bash
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [^pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{MgnlO942e9KIgqaAZ75k89GLwOo.dZjM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$
```


**Flag:** `pwn.college{MgnlO942e9KIgqaAZ75k89GLwOo.dZjM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>
