# Module 6: Practicing Piping
## 1. Redirecting output

**Task:** Redirect the output of the command to write `PWN` into a file named `COLLEGE`

**Process:** Use the `echo` command followed by `>` to create the file and write the desired output

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{UpUUp_0NFwmWVFk09ZtA_pDrKiH.dRjN1QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{UpUUp_0NFwmWVFk09ZtA_pDrKiH.dRjN1QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 2. Redirecting more output

**Task:** Redirect the output of the command `/challenge/run` to save the flag in the file `myflag`

**Process:** Use the `>` operator to capture the standard output of the command while allowing standard error to still display in the terminal

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run > myflag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : myflag
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called myflag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{wO-F1hIRXt3TEp8Tx3-NV7dEa32.dVjN1QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wO-F1hIRXt3TEp8Tx3-NV7dEa32.dVjN1QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 3. Appending output

**Task:** Append the output of the command `/challenge/run` to the file `/home/hacker/the-flag` without overwriting previous content

**Process:** Use the `>>` operator to ensure that both halves of the flag are saved in the same file without deleting earlier output
</br>
first we use truncation mode `>` and then we use append mode `>>`
</br>
as If we use `>>` first and `>` afterwards, weâ€™ll get only the second half as `>` overwrites the file.



**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll
get the whole flag!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ cat /home/hacker/the-flag
 |
\|/ This is the first half:
 v
pwn.college{wgMitp0Vmr940G0UzejPZV9tIry.ddDM5QDLxYTN0czW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>)
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append
mode!

```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wgMitp0Vmr940G0UzejPZV9tIry.ddDM5QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 4. Redirecting error

**Task:** Redirect the standard output of `/challenge/run` to the file `myflag` and the standard error to the file `instructions`

**Process:**  Use the `>` operator for standard output and `2>` for standard error to save both outputs to their respective files without displaying anything in the terminal

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ /challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat instructions
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : myflag
[INFO] - the challenge will check that error output is redirected to a specific file path : instructions
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called myflag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stderr to instructions. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stderr looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{EAMKoeb_hIh0_RguhXcRv2Akw28.ddjN1QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{EAMKoeb_hIh0_RguhXcRv2Akw28.ddjN1QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 5. Redirecting input

**Task:** Redirect the contents of the `PWN` file, which should contain "COLLEGE," as input to the command `/challenge/run`

**Process:** First, use output redirection to write "COLLEGE" to the `PWN` file, then use the `<` operator to feed that file as input to `/challenge/run`

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8r9J28kT8mqwZdzx2EJ7qPbw9QH.dBzN1QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8r9J28kT8mqwZdzx2EJ7qPbw9QH.dBzN1QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 6. Grepping stored result

**Task:** Redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to the file `/tmp/data.txt` and then search for the flag within that file using `grep`

**Process:** Use the `>` operator to save the output to `/tmp/data.txt`, and then run `grep` on that file to locate the flag

**Code:** _(redirected error to shorten length.)_
```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt 2> instructions
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt
pwn.college{cii03UmLk31Ajz27LuNKuSbbK1H.dhTM4QDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cii03UmLk31Ajz27LuNKuSbbK1H.dhTM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 7. Grepping live output

**Task:** Use the pipe operator to connect the output of `/challenge/run` directly to `grep` to search for the flag without storing the output in a file

**Process:** Execute `/challenge/run | grep flag` to filter the output in real-time and display the flag

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ echo /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/xpq4yhadyhazkcsggmqd7rsgvxb3kjy4-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stdout!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
pwn.college{06xvDVCv18fLtjpt9uo3z9qrs45.dlTM4QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{06xvDVCv18fLtjpt9uo3z9qrs45.dlTM4QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 8. Grepping errors

**Task:** Redirect standard error to standard output, then pipe the combined output to `grep` to search for the flag

**Process:** Execute `/challenge/run 2>&1 | grep flag` to capture both standard output and standard error and filter for the flag
</br>
did a lot of trial and error for this. 
There's `FD1`, and `FD2` for standard op and error respectively. 
as per the problem, we need the description/instruction messages for the flag
and we need to direct that into the grep function. So we use pipe `|`
`2&>1` -> `stderr` and `stdout` works in a single stream. 


**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-errors:~$ /challenge/run 2>&1 | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stderr : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stderr to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/xpq4yhadyhazkcsggmqd7rsgvxb3kjy4-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stderr!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
pwn.college{Y_Seekq_F30cEvxtmhHOP68nC7a.dVDM5QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y_Seekq_F30cEvxtmhHOP68nC7a.dVDM5QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 9. Duplicating piped data with tee

**Task:** Use `tee` to intercept and inspect data while piping it from `/challenge/pwn` to `/challenge/college`

**Process:** 

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee ~/lol | /challenge/college
Processing...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat lol
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "sWLVdpO_"
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret sWLVdpO_| tee ~/lol | /challenge/college
Processing...
WARNING: you are overwriting file /home/hacker/lol with tee's output...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sWLVdpO_N6VPhzaWAUTWsLkjYyW.dFjM5QDLxYTN0czW}
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sWLVdpO_N6VPhzaWAUTWsLkjYyW.dFjM5QDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 10. Writing to multiple programs

**Task:** Duplicate the output of the `/challenge/hack` command to both the `/challenge/the` and `/challenge/planet` commands using process substitution with `tee` 

**Process:** Run `/challenge/hack | tee >( /challenge/the ) >( /challenge/planet )` to capture the output and send it to both commands simultaneously

**Code:**
```bash
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) | /challenge/planet
Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here
is your flag:
pwn.college{olNUdcjALSVHJDCSvmzgWQ8wNbF.dBDO0UDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{olNUdcjALSVHJDCSvmzgWQ8wNbF.dBDO0UDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>

## 11. Split-piping stderr and stdout

**Task:** Redirect stdout of `/challenge/hack` to `/challenge/planet` and stderr to `/challenge/the` without mixing the two

**Process:** Run `/challenge/hack > >( /challenge/planet ) 2> >( /challenge/the )` to separately handle stdout and stderr using process substitution

**Code:**
```bash
/challenge/hack > >(/challenge/planet) 2> >(/challenge/the)
Congratulations, you have learned a redirection technique that even experts
struggle with! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8WxlRboWu_KgwkODlS5uCepYlxu.dFDNwYDLxYTN0czW}
hacker@piping~split-piping-stderr-and-stdout:~$
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8WxlRboWu_KgwkODlS5uCepYlxu.dFDNwYDLxYTN0czW}`
</br>
